### Record Telemetry

-   This app allows users to save all telemetry to a CSV file for later analysis
-   All incoming telemetry data is saved (along with the timestamp)

    This gif was created by using the Recording feature and <a href="https://github.com/austinbaccus/forza-map-visualization">Forza Map Visualization</a> to make a 3D trace of the player's XYZ coordinates during a race

### Map Trail

-   Your car's path will be drawn in real-time as you drive around in either Motorsport or Horizon

### Fuel Management

-   Displays the number of laps you can go until you run out of fuel
-   Displays the amount of fuel consumed per lap
-   Displays your car's MPG

### Lap Dashboard

-   Displays time and split time for every lap, not just your best and previous lap

### Runs on your Local Machine

-   Forza Telemetry uses a UDP loopback so that you can run this program on the same computer that you're using to play Forza

## ‚ùì FAQ <a name="faq"></a>

### Why does the MPG value look off?

Because Forza calculates fuel consumption in a very strange way. Also, Forza cars have an unknown amount of fuel, so calculating the Miles Per Gallon figure is a bit tricky. The app assumes that each car has roughly 13 gallons of fuel to arrive at a number for MPG (13 gallons of fuel is a typical amount for a road car).

### Why is the app running slowly?

Most likely the map has too much data to render.

### Why do some things look out of place?

This app looks best when it's in a 1920x1080 window (and looks even better in fullscreen mode). When the window deviates from this size, some visual elements might be placed incorrectly.

### Can I use this app with an Xbox?

Not yet. That is a feature I'd like to implement eventually.
